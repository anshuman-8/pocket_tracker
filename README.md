# Pocket Tracker

This is our project for Hackathon [Hack@Arch](https://hackatarch.devfolio.co/) 2021, Conducted by GECT.

## Description
Pocket tracker is a money management app for every common man's usage.
The main goal of the app is to help you to efficiently keep track of your expenses.
The app has a very intuitive and easy to understand User Interface.
Upon opening the app, the user has to click a photo of his receipt. Our app's algorithm will extract the total amount from the receipt and ask the user to tag it with a label like grocery, medical, food, fuel, apparel etc.
The app shows a donut pie chart to the user to show him how much money he has spent category wise and will also give an alert when the budget is about to be over.
Additionally, the app also has a page for recent bills, where the user can view his past bills, along with the timestamp and its label, saving the user from the hassle of misplacing the receipt.
## Our team's vision towards this App
The long term vision of our team towards this project is to make the money management easy for a common man.
Initially we had a lot of ideas for this project, but due to the stipulated time frame, we applied only the main ideas as of now. Our future ideas are : -
enabling the app to read the user's bank transaction history by reading his/her bank sms, and storing this data in our app, extending it not only to paper receipts but also digital purchases
automate the process of entering the category of the transaction by using ML models to identify the category of purchase.
